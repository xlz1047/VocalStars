NanoPitch Model — a lightweight neural network for real-time pitch tracking.

=== What This Model Does ===

Given a short chunk of audio (represented as a mel spectrogram), the model
predicts two things at every 10ms time step:

  1. VAD (Voice Activity Detection): Is someone singing/speaking right now?
     Output: a probability between 0 and 1.

  2. Pitch Posteriorgram: What pitch is being sung?
     Output: 360 probabilities, one for each possible pitch bin.
     The bins cover 6 octaves (B0 through ~B6) at 20-cent resolution.
     A "cent" is 1/100 of a semitone — so 20 cents ≈ 1/5 of a semitone.

=== Architecture (adapted from RNNoise) ===

The model uses GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units), which are a type of recurrent
neural network well-suited for sequential data like audio. GRUs can "remember"
what they heard in previous frames, which helps track pitch continuously.

Signal flow:
    40 mel bands (input)
      │
      ▼
    Conv1d(40 → 64, kernel=3) + tanh    ← extract local patterns
    Conv1d(64 → 96, kernel=3) + tanh    ← combine into features
      │
      ▼
    GRU layer 1 (96 units)              ← track patterns over time
    GRU layer 2 (96 units)              ← deeper temporal modeling
    GRU layer 3 (96 units)              ← even deeper
      │
      ▼
    Concatenate [conv_out, gru1, gru2, gru3] = 384 features
      │
      ├──→ Dense(384 → 1)   + sigmoid  → VAD probability
      └──→ Dense(384 → 360) + sigmoid  → pitch posteriorgram

Total: ~333K parameters — small enough to run on a laptop CPU or in a browser.

=== Why This Design? ===

- Conv layers act as a learned feature extractor (like a smarter mel filterbank)
- GRU layers capture temporal context (pitch is continuous, not independent per frame)
- Multiple GRU layers at different depths capture different time scales
- Concatenating all layers gives the output heads access to both low-level
  and high-level features (a "skip connection" pattern from RNNoise)
- Sigmoid outputs ensure values are in [0, 1], interpretable as probabilities
